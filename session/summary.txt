## Report: India's Rising Per Capita Income and its Differential Impact

### Introduction
This report examines the impact of India's rising per capita income on different segments of the population, focusing on the disparities between the rich and the poor.

### Main Findings / Analysis
India's economy is growing, but wealth inequality is a significant concern. The top 1% of India's population holds over 40% of the nation's wealth, while the bottom 50% owns only 3%. The top 10% earn over 57% of the national income. Income inequality in India is reportedly worse than under British rule. Despite this, poverty in India had fallen to a historic low in 2022.

### Conclusion
Rising per capita income does not translate to equal benefits across the population. The wealth is concentrated within a small percentage of the population, leading to vast income disparities.

### Recommendations
Investors and businesses should consider the vast income disparity and tailor their strategies accordingly. Focus on inclusive growth and addressing the needs of the lower-income segments may unlock significant market potential.
